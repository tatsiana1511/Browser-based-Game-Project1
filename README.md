## Why
This memory game is aiming to help the players to train their focus and memory capacity.

Even though we as developers shouldn't memorize but understand, developing the memory has positive effects like improving information retention at any age, improve neuroplasticity in the elderly and stave off typical cognitive decline by seven to fourteen years.

## About the game
In the beginning the game has 2 boards with images facing down:

The goal is to guess all the image pairs on both boards:

Look carefully, you will have **5** seconds to remember as many pairs of cards as you can.

Once the cards are faced down again click on the left board to open the first picture. Then try to find a match on the right board.

You will have first 2 attempts to gain points, you don't lose anything if you miss the match. Then for every match found you get 5 points and you lose 2 if you miss. 

Be careful, if your points score goes negative you lose. You win when all the matches are found and your points balance is equal or more than 0.
